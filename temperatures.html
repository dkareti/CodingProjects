        <h1>Temperature Conversion</h1>
        <p> If you know the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, then the 
conversion to degrees Celsius is fairly simple. All you have to do is follow a
simple algebraic function. Let's assume that the temperature in fahrenheit is 
denoted by the letter x. There are only two steps to follow:<br>
    1. Subtract x by 32.<br>
    2. Then multiply the result by the fraction 5/9.<br> 
Following these steps will result in a value that is the celsius equivalent to 
the temperature in Fahrenheit.</p>
